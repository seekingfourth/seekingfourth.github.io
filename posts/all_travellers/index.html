Have you ever noticed that all of us know(consciously or unconsciously) that we are not just the body but we are something more? Have you paid attention to statements like “I am having a body ache!”. Who is having the body ache? If you are not just the body, who are you then? We satisfy our intellect by trying to know so many things. But, does it ever get satisfied? As Maharshi Ramana says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>instead of trying to know things, we should try to know the knower!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Then there will be nothing left to know. Our body is the grossest manifestation of something very fine which is eternal, knower and the unchangeable. Bliss is its natural state. Our body has taken so much control over ourselves that we stay in a state of ignorance and always pursue its need which slowly becomes greed. This is a blind unconscious effort in pursuit of happiness. Our bodies are like our carriers. Life is something like travelling in train, we board it and disembark it. What we have done is that we have given control to train to decide our destination instead of taking control of our destination. Is this the way to travel? As Sadhguru says, our lives have been hijacked!</p>
<p>
We need to restrict ourselves to our graceful needs. In a train, if you are not getting a berth, it is okay to make efforts to get one. If you are not getting food, it is okay to make efforts to get it. But, it is sheer non-sense to reserve multiple berths, accumulating food more than you need. In doing so, you withdraw your attention from passing by scenic beauty. You tend to forget your destination because you are so much lost in stuff collection that you start defining and restricting yourself with the stuff you have collected. And, in doing so, you create problems to fellow passengers. When you acquire things more than you need, you are taking someone else’s share. Believe it, you may get transient happiness in doing so but you can never attain a state of bliss! Pay attention to the journey’s beauty! Be courteous to your fellow passengers as like you they are also travelling! <strong>Tool to know real you is self-enquiry</strong>. I have not experienced it, but I know this is the only truth to pursue. I wish to experience it someday and so should you!</p>
