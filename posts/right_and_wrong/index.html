Life keeps presenting choices in front of us, and we have to make one every time. It is an interesting thing that everyone makes the right choice, and does the right thing. No? Yes. You will also hear statements like &#34;I am doing this wrong…&#34; because &#34;it is the right thing to do at this moment&#34;. Basically, our inner instrument justifies the righteousness of our wrong action. But, such statements remain in the projected light of one&#39;s own knowledge. So, how right our right is?</p>
<p>
What decides right or wrong? Let&#39;s start with life itself. We choose to live, so we eat regulalry, try to maintain a healthy lifestyle so that we don&#39;t fall sick, or if we fall sick, we take remedies. We do everything which is &#39;right&#39; to live. Let&#39;s say I plan to go to Kedarnath. It would be wrong if I book a flight ticket to Goa. So, right and wrong are relative to what we want to achieve.</p>
<p>
Now, what we want to achieve may be different than what we should try to achieve. Life is a collection of different achievements as we go through different phases. The choice is not always clear between right and wrong. We don&#39;t know what is right, because we lack a broader view. The choices fall more on moral ground. For example, if we lie or cheat someone to attain something, would it be right? It might be right for our immediate desire, but does it evolve us or does it degrade us? How do we get to know overall right for all the activities we do in our lives? What one achievement or goal are they all aligned to?</p>
<p>
Seers are the people who see existence with a broader view and suggest the purpose of life - enlightenment or liberation or a state of being-consciousness-bliss. All the actions which are done aligning to this goal are right in true sense. Others, which deviate, are wrong. But, these wrong are not forever, these are errors which can be corrected with efforts. The beauty is this: doing such right is our evolution, sooner or later.</p>
