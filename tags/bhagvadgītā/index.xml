      <description>We know, we live in a world of cause and effect. So, each of our actions causes some effects on the world and on us. Whatever actions we perform, they leave residues in our mind. If we receive happiness from some action, we want more of it or fear the absence of it. On the other hand, if it is grief, we want to run away from it. These residues build our tendencies, make our world of likes and dislikes, and propel us to act further putting us in a vicious cycle of cause and effect.</description>
