      <description>Be Calm - A short story  My father in his early years was curious to see/wear his uncleâ€™s expensive watch. But, he was refrained from doing so. So, he tried it when the uncle was out on his job. As my father held the watch with curiosity, he dropped it on floor. He became nervous of the cold fear of breaking it. Now, with trembling hands, he picked up the watch and it was all good, but being in trembling hands it got dropped again.</description>

      <description>A bit old but it is vivid. Rishikesh (Hrishikesha) literally means &amp;#39;lord of the senses&amp;#39;. I interpret it as this is the starting point geographically to make further spiritual exploration in the mystic Himalayas. Also, Spiritual progress is not possible without control over the senses.
 Rishikesh is considered as world capital of Yoga and a suitable place for the people who want to peep into spiritual life. My college happened to be close to Rishikesh and I could make several visits just to hangout.</description>
