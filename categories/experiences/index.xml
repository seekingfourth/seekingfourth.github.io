      <description>Once I was sitting with 3 years old in the balcony; pre-dawn, facing west. Soon we noticed sudden shift in light, and a short conversation triggered:
 I: See that Sun has risen
 She: Where is it?
 I: You see the sunlight now and that&amp;#39;s a sign that sun is there
 She: Why can&amp;#39;t I see it then?
 I: We are facing in the opposite direction, and because of the buildings we can&amp;#39;t see it.</description>

      <description>A bit old but it is vivid. Rishikesh (Hrishikesha) literally means &amp;#39;lord of the senses&amp;#39;. I interpret it as this is the starting point geographically to make further spiritual exploration in the mystic Himalayas. Also, Spiritual progress is not possible without control over the senses.
 Rishikesh is considered as world capital of Yoga and a suitable place for the people who want to peep into spiritual life. My college happened to be close to Rishikesh and I could make several visits just to hangout.</description>
