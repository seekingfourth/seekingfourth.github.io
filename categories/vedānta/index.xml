      <description>Viveka, the intellectual capability to discriminate between real and unreal is the first among the four-fold qualifications in a sādhak (seeker).

 नित्यमात्मस्वरूपं हि दृश्यं तद्विपरीतगम् ।
 एवं यो निश्चयः सम्यग्विवेको वस्तुनः स वै ।।
 अपरोक्षानुभूतिः
  Ātman (the seer) in itself is alone permanent, the seen is opposed to it (i.e. transient) - such a settled conviction is truly known as Viveka (discrimination between real and unreal)</description>

      <description> Introduction  Vedānta is combination of two words: Veda means Knowledge and anta means end. So, it means end of knowledge.
 This is not pessimistic end of knowledge, it means a state where there is nothing more to be known.
 Since the end portions of Vedas, talk and provide instructions to attain such state, they are also called Vedānta.

      <description>We know, we live in a world of cause and effect. So, each of our actions causes some effects on the world and on us. Whatever actions we perform, they leave residues in our mind. If we receive happiness from some action, we want more of it or fear the absence of it. On the other hand, if it is grief, we want to run away from it. These residues build our tendencies, make our world of likes and dislikes, and propel us to act further putting us in a vicious cycle of cause and effect.</description>

      <description>ॐ शांतिः शांतिः शांतिः ।। (Om! Peace! Peace! Peace!)
 Everybody wants peace, not for idleness but for activity too. Without peace, life would be at constant war externally and internally. It can&amp;#39;t make any progressive development. However, it has become such a rare phenomenon that people have actually started considering it as an ultimate goal in life:
 Peace is not the ultimate goal, but the most fundamental requirement in one’s life.</description>
