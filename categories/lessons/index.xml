      <description>Be Calm - A short story  My father in his early years was curious to see/wear his uncleâ€™s expensive watch. But, he was refrained from doing so. So, he tried it when the uncle was out on his job. As my father held the watch with curiosity, he dropped it on floor. He became nervous of the cold fear of breaking it. Now, with trembling hands, he picked up the watch and it was all good, but being in trembling hands it got dropped again.</description>
